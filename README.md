# DS-and-Algorithms
    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this course, I had to build a course planner that would read the CSV file, store data, sort it, print it out, and search for the information. I had to compare different data structures to find the best one that meets the requirement and has great runtime complexity. 

    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I created a pseudocode for each considered data structure and analyzed the runtime of each approach. The ability to understand data structure and its implementation helps to build a project that runs efficiently. 

    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome the challenges, I had to solve some non-related tasks to fully understand how the concepts work, check the real-world implementations of the problems and approach my professor for additional guidance.

  How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project highlighted the importance of the analysis stage. The knowledge gained about runtime complexity added valuable insight into choosing the most effective algorithm.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   The project's work has helped me prioritize clean and reusable code. This experience emphasized the influence of the research and analysis stages on the successful result.
